# Design Choices, Evaluation, Iterations

## Naive Attempt

### Design

This attempt focuses on making a basic solution without any optimizations applied.

**Task 1:** 2D Array, makes accessing specific grid elements relatively simple (i.e. grid[j][i]). Will need to handle BCs carefully.

**Task 2:** Copy the old grid to the new, then only modify the interior elements.

### Performance

The initial benchmark produced the following results:

| Run | Runtime (ms) | Score |
|---:|-------------:|------:|
| 1   | 880.793      | 0.295 |
| 2   | 758.849      | 0.457 |
| 3   | 887.474      | 0.271 |

The baseline is significantly slower than the provided reference implementation, with all three runs producing a score below 1. This establishes that the initial implementation requires performance improvements.

The relatively large variation between runs also suggests that individual benchmark runs should not be treated as exact measurements; subsequent optimizations will be evaluated using repeated runs and compared against this baseline.

## Optimization 1

### Observation

In the first iteration, our operator function was as follows:

```cpp
double& Grid::operator()(std::size_t i, std::size_t j) {
  if (i >= rows_ || j >= cols_) throw std::out_of_range("Grid index out of bounds");
  return grid_[i][j];
}
```

For every element, recall that we'd be doing this check 5 times per interior node. This easily blows up when faced with increased node count. To optimize, ensure proper handling within the apply_stencil() function.

### Performance

| Run | Runtime (ms) | Score |
|---:|-------------:|------:|
| 1   | 515.413      | 0.611 |
| 2   | 399.500      | 0.564 |
| 3   | 396.338      | 0.562 |
| 4   | 527.738      | 0.441 |

## Optimization 2

### Observation

Computation is largely the same across every node, so this optimization parallelizes row computation across threads instead of running it serially.

**Added functions**:

```cpp
void calculate_row(const std::vector<double> &top,
                   const std::vector<double> &middle,
                   const std::vector<double> &bottom,
                   std::vector<double> &output) {
  std::size_t cols = top.size();
  for (std::size_t j = 1; j < cols - 1; ++j) {
    output[j] = 0.5 * middle[j] +
                0.125 * (middle[j - 1] + middle[j + 1] + top[j] + bottom[j]);
  }
}

void calculate_row_group(const Grid &input_grid, Grid &output_grid,
                         std::size_t begin, std::size_t end) {
  for (std::size_t i = begin; i < end; ++i) {
    calculate_row(input_grid(i + 1), input_grid(i), input_grid(i - 1),
                  output_grid(i));
  }
}
```

**Modified Stencil Code**:
```cpp
void apply_stencil(const Grid &old_grid, Grid &new_grid) {
  auto [rows, cols] = old_grid.get_grid_dims();
  new_grid = old_grid;
  if (rows < 3 || cols < 3)
    return;

  std::vector<std::thread> threads;
  std::size_t interior_rows = rows - 2;
  std::size_t base = interior_rows / groups;
  std::size_t remainder = interior_rows % groups;

  std::size_t begin = 1;

  for (std::size_t g = 0; g < groups; ++g) {
    std::size_t chunk_size = base + (g < remainder ? 1 : 0);
    std::size_t end = begin + chunk_size;

    threads.emplace_back(calculate_row_group, std::cref(old_grid),
                         std::ref(new_grid), begin, end);

    begin = end;
  }

  for (auto &thread : threads) {
    thread.join();
  }
}
```

### Performance

| Thread Count | Average Runtime (ms) | Average Score |
|-------------:|----------------------:|---------------:|
| 1            | 387.377               | 0.486          |
| 10           | 334.851               | 0.569          |
| 16           | 332.414               | 0.581          |

## Optimization 3
### Observation

We don't actually need to copy the whole grid to satisfy the halo conditions (constant BCs). A whole bunch of computation is wasted for copying the old grid to the new one, when instead we can create another wrapper function to satisfy the conditions by iterating over the grid manually.

### Performance

| Run | Runtime (ms) | Score |
|---:|-------------:|------:|
| 1   | 177.214      | 0.935 |
| 2   | 176.190     | 1.010 |
| 3   | 176.958      | 1.021 |
| 4   | 188.581     | 0.966 |

## Optimization 4
### Observation

We can use tiling to improve cache locality by keeping the working set of each computation tile small enough to make better use of the L1 cache. Since the stencil is memory-bound rather than compute-bound, reducing the cost of memory accesses can improve overall performance.

### Performance

| Tile Size | Average Score |
|---:|-------------:|
| 16   | 1.2 |
| 32   | 1.696|
| 64   | 1.678|
| 128 | 1.725 |
|256 | 1.752 |
| 512 | | 1.772 |

Note, this is lower than our run with 1.9 (using OpenMP). The primary hypothesis behind why tiling didn't work is because the current memory layout (flattened, 1D array) is already very cache friendly.
